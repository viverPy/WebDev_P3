              Jack’s Bar and Kitchen is the brainchild of Ryan and John
              McElhinney. We are located at 96 Isabella Street (behind Southwark
              Tube) SE1 8DD. The original Jack’s was opened in Ireland in 1970
              by their father Jack so the boys decided to pay tribute to their
              father by re-opening the original almost forty years on. Jack's is
              a bar for birthdays, catching up with friends, lunch on our patio
              in our winter garden, craft beer, cocktails and delicious Thai
              food.
